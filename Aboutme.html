      <h2>Mariah Salmon</h2>
      <p>Hello everyone! As it says above my name is Mariah.  I am from Willard, Utah, but I currently live in Rexburg. I'm 24 and I'm the sixth kid out of seven. I have 5 brothers and 1 sister. I love reading, makeup, fashion, music, and comedy.</p>
      
      <p>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor degree in Computer Science, but I might change to Software Engineering. I have spent the last 5 years working at the DMV in Ogden Utah and intermittently pursuing a degree online.  As of this last fall semester I have moved to Rexburg to continue to pursue a degree full time and I am now currently working at the Mountain America Credit Union Service Center as a service agent. I am taking this course to learn how to build websites and hope to use this knowledge in my future career. I love technology and think it's amazing what we can do with it and I'm excited to learn how to build websites.</p>
      
      <p> I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints all of my life. My favorite quote from a church leader is from President Uchtdorf when he said, "Your own wondrous story has already begun. Your "once upon a time" is now.</p>
